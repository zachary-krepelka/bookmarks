=head1 NAME

youtube.pl - extract and organize YouTube bookmarks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

perl youtube.pl [options] <netscape-bookmark-file>

options: [ -h | -H ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objective: given a Netscape bookmark file INPUT, to extract only
YouTube-related bookmarks from that file, and to subsequently
restructure those extracted bookmarks into a new Netscape bookmark file
OUTPUT with the following file structure.

	YouTube/
	|-- Content/
	|   |-- Shorts/
	|   |   `-- ...
	|   `-- Longs/
	|       `-- ...
	|-- Comments/
	|   `-- ...
	|-- Playlists/
	|   `-- ...
	|-- Channels/
	|   `-- ...
	|-- Subpages/
	|   `-- ...
	|-- Searches/
	|   `-- ...
	`-- Misc/
	    `-- ...

=head2 File Structure, Sorting Order, and Naming Conventions

The bookmarks are organized into several folders outlined below.  The
bookmarks in each folder are sorted by their names lexicographically in
a case-insensitive manner unless otherwise specified.  If the INPUT file
does not contain any YouTube bookmarks of a particular kind, then the
corresponding folder will not be populated in the OUTPUT file.  The
trailing C< - YouTube> tag is stripped from the end of each bookmark
name.

=over

=item 1) Content

This folder contains standalone playable content.  It is divided into
two subfolders for short-form and long-form content.

=over

=item i) Shorts

Contains YouTube bookmarks with URLs of the form

	youtube.com/shorts/{VIDEO_ID}

=item ii) Longs

Contains YouTube bookmarks with URLs of the form

	youtube.com/watch?v={VIDEO_ID}

This includes videos that are part of a playlist, e.g.,

	youtube.com/watch?v={VIDEO_ID}&list={PLAYLIST_ID}&index={NUM}

However, URLs containing a comment query parameter are excluded.  The
reason for this is discussed below.

=back

=item 2) Comments

This folder contains bookmarked YouTube comments.  These are bookmarks
with URLs of the form

	youtube.com/watch?v={VIDEO_ID}&lc={COMMENT_ID}

These URLs are obtained by clicking on a YouTube comment's timestamp,
which redirects back to the same video but with the selected comment now
hoisted to the top of the comment section.  (YouTube short comments
redirect to a page having the Short as a full video.)

While the content folder is reserved for standalone playable content, it
is understood that if a video contains a comment as part of its link,
then that link was saved with the express purpose of saving the comment
rather than the video, which is why these links get their own folder.

The comments are organized into the following file structure, where they
are grouped according to the video to which they belong.

	Comments/
	|-- video1/
	|   |-- comment1
	|   |-- comment2
	|   `-- ...
	|-- video2/
	|   |-- comment1
	|   |-- comment2
	|   `-- ...
	`-- ...

Each video folder is named with that video's title, and the bookmarked
comments in each video folder retain their original names.  The video
folders are sorted case insensitively by name, as one would expect.  By
contrast, the bookmarked comments in each folder are sorted by their
comment IDs.

The reason for this sorting order is because each bookmarked comment
under a given video is given the same name--the name of its parent
video--by the web browser.  Therefore, sorting lexicographically would
accomplish nothing unless the user manually names each bookmarked
comment.

=item 3) Playlists

This folder contains bookmarked playlist pages.  These are bookmarks
with URLs of the form

	youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID

A dedicated playlist page is a standalone list of YouTube videos; it
does not play content but rather comprises a collection of content.  It
should not be confused with the playlist interface that often
accompanies videos.

=item 4) Channels

This folder contains bookmarked channel pages.  These are bookmarks with
URLs of the form

	youtube.com/user/USERNAME
	youtube.com/channel/CHANNEL_ID
	youtube.com/c/CUSTOM_NAME
	youtube.com/@HANDLE

=item 5) Subpages

This folder contains sub pages belonging to specific channels.  These
are bookmarks with URLs of the form

	youtube.com/@HANDLE/SUBPAGE

Possible sub pages follow: featured, videos, shorts, streams, podcasts,
releases, playlists, posts, and store.  These correspond to the tabs on
a YouTube channel page.

These bookmarks are placed into this folder as a flat list with the
following naming scheme.

	Subpages/
	|-- FEATURED some_channel
	|-- PLAYLISTS some_channel
	|-- PODCASTS some_channel
	|-- POSTS some_channel
	|-- RELEASES some_channel
	|-- SHORTS some_channel
	|-- STORE some_channel
	|-- STREAMS some_channel
	|-- VIDEOS some_channel
	`-- ...

This folder is like the C<Channels> folder; it contains the same set of
permissible URLs.  Thereon, if one of the aforementioned URLs has a sub
path beyond the channel specifier, it is placed here instead of in the
C<Channels> folder.

=item 6) Searches

This folder contains bookmarked search queries.  These are bookmarks
with URLs of the form

	youtube.com/results?search_query=WHAT_YOU_SEARCHED

Often it is the case that pages like these are bookmarked accidentally.
You may want to bookmark a search query if you are frequently returning
to it, e.g., in the case of an ongoing event in the news.

=item 7) Misc

This folder contains YouTube bookmarks that do not fall into any of the
previous categories.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Display a [h]elp message and exit.

=item B<-H>, B<--docs>

Display this documentation in a pager and exit after the user quits.
The documentation is divided into sections.  Each section header is
matched with a search pattern, meaning that you can use navigation
commands like C<n> and its counterpart C<N> to go to the next or
previous section respectively.

The uppercase -H is to parallel the lowercase -h.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

Only the standard domain is matched.

	https://www.youtube.com/...

Bookmarks using other domains, like those listed below, are not matched.

	https://youtu.be/...
	https://m.youtube.com/...
	https://music.youtube.com/...
	etc.
